# Strings in Python
# In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (either single, double, or triple quotes). Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after they are created.

# Creating Strings
# There are several ways to create strings in Python:

# Single Quotes: my_string = 'Hello, World!'
# Double Quotes: my_string = "Hello, World!"
# Triple Quotes: my_string = '''Hello, World!''' (can span multiple lines)
# Raw Strings: my_string = r'Hello, World!' (treats backslashes as literal characters)


#for multi line string use triple quotes '''any string'''
my_string: str = '''Hello,
World!'''
print(my_string)
