# You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports. For example, alison heck should be capitalised correctly as Alison Heck.


# Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately.

# Input Format

# A single line of input containing the full name, .

# Constraints

# The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.

sttr = " syed    mhamil    ali"
# for i in sttr.split():
#     sttr=sttr.replace(i,i.capitalize())
#     print()
# print(sttr)   
# 

# result=""
# capitalized = True
# for char in sttr:
#     if char == " ":
#         result+=char
#         capitalized= True
#     elif capitalized:
#         result+=char.upper()
#         capitalized =False
#     else:
#         result+=char 
    
# print(f"the result is just first letter capital: {result}")





# result = ""
