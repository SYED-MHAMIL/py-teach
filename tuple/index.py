# Why Use Tuples?

# Immutable: Since tuples cannot be changed, they are safer to use when you want to ensure that the data remains constant.
# Hashable: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are immutable.
# Performance: Tuples are generally faster than lists because of their immutability.
# When to Use Tuples vs Lists
# Use tuples when you want to store data that should not change (e.g., coordinates, constants).
# Use lists when you need a collection that can be modified (e.g., adding or removing elements).
